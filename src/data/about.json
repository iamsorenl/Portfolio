        "about": "Hi, I’m Soren Larsen! I’m a graduate student in Natural Language Processing at UC Santa Cruz, focused on how AI and NLP can improve digital experiences. Previously, I worked on Boardal, a surfboard marketplace app where users can buy and sell surfboards and surf gear. Outside of my studies, I’m interested in applying AI and machine learning to web and mobile development. I also stay active in the local tech community by attending events like those hosted by Santa Cruz Works. I’m always open to connecting with others in tech. Whether it’s AI, potential collaborations, or surfing, feel free to reach out!"
