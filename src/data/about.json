        "about": "👋 Hi, I’m Soren Larsen! I’m a graduate student in Natural Language Processing at UC Santa Cruz, where I also work as a Teaching Assistant for courses like Business Information Systems and Systems Analysis and Design. My role involves mentoring students, guiding project teams, and helping them master concepts like databases, agile methodologies, and UML modeling.\n\n🏄‍♂️ I also work at Boardal, a surfboard marketplace app where users can buy and sell surfboards and surf gear. The platform allows users to create personalized watchlists for surfboards, receive custom notifications for matches, and facilitate seamless communication between buyers and sellers.\n\n🌐 I’m passionate about applying AI and machine learning to create solutions for areas I care about, such as automating tasks to improve efficiency and leveraging NLP to tailor education or simplify complex ideas. My focus is on designing tools that are not just functional but also user-friendly and impactful, helping people better understand and interact with technology.\n\n🎉 I stay active in the local tech community by attending events like those hosted by Santa Cruz Works. I enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals and staying up to date on the latest trends in technology and innovation.\n\n🤝 I’m always open to connecting with others in tech. Whether it’s AI, potential collaborations, teaching, or surfing, feel free to reach out!"
